## Issues (that I know of 😅)
- Microsoft hasn't shared their Unicode 15 assets.
- Some emoji names don't match the unicode description:
  - 😵 Dizzy face
  - 🤗 Hugging face
  - 😡 Pouting Face
- Some pre-unicode 15 emoji are missing from their SVG set:
  - 🎮 Video game
## Web 5 Challenges
- [Quickstart guide](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did) is still incorrect. [See issue here](https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website/issues/1070#event-11367598025).
