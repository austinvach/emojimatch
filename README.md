## Issues (that I know of ðŸ˜…)
- Microsoft hasn't shared their Unicode 15 assets.
- Some emoji names don't match the unicode description (Microsoft name in parenthesis):
  - ðŸ˜µ Face with crossed-out eyes (Dizzy)
  - ðŸ¤— Smiling face with open hands (Hugging face)
  - ðŸ˜¡ Enraged face (Pouting Face)
- Some pre-unicode 15 emoji are missing from their SVG set:
  - ðŸŽ® Video game
## Web 5 Challenges
- [Quickstart guide](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did) is still incorrect. [See issue here](https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website/issues/1070#event-11367598025).
